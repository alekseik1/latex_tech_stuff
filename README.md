# latex_tech_stuff

I'm using LaTeX very often but managing preambula files between different projects is a real disaster.
That's why I decided to keep all my environments and imports in a single place!

## How to use
You can either download a whole repo and unzip it in your latex project folder
or (_recommended_) add this project as a submodule.
